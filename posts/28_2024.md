I'm 2 days delayed in posting the blog for the 28th week of 2024. I won't make excuses, but I was lazy enough to not prioritize this blog. Maybe it is because of the fatigue to write this week in week out. But let's do this.

Personal updates:

Guilty of not going to swimming this week. I won't make excuse of bad weather or work. I have to make sure I go the following week and go harder. I see the swimming cap and glasses staring at me when I open the drawer. Makes me sad tbh, lol.

Went out with my college friends to play badminton this sunday. Spent some pretty good 2 hours of intense badminton with impromptu fun bits. Funny part is I'm meeting a few of them after ages, maybe just after the last day of college. Pretty sure we will make this a ritual and keep it up.

I started with Duolingo for Japanese learning. I'm on section 4, I believe and it is helping me with sentence formation really well. I now understand that when we say "Pizza is tasty", it translates to "Piza wa oishiidesu" (ピザはおいしいです) which was shocking to me for the reason that Hiragana and Katakana CAN go together in the same sentence. While this maybe relevant information for you smart pants, but I was shook. 

Professional updates:

Working towards my goal to crack AWS SAA-C03. Planning to jot down the concepts and share it here from next week to make myself hold accountable for my progress and blogging at the same time. Win-win indeed.

From next blogs, I'll be adding a few more sections, maybe some quote which I got to know from the book that I'm reading and to update the CR books. Adios.
