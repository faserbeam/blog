This blog was written after a lot of procrastination. Thankfully, I've a habit tracker which acts like agony aunt and forces me to feed blogs week in and out. My brain was acting like "Spiderman Meme", it was just finding excuses. For those who are living under the rock and don't know about that meme. Got you covered.

Personal updates:

This weekend, tried the new outlet of [1441 Pizzeria][1441], it had 4.5+ ratings on Zomato which was surprising at first. I've been to 1441 before, the Malad outlet, but this one was pretty spacious. We tried the 8" Paneer Tikka Pizza, 8" Farm Pesto Pizza and Pink Sauce Pasta. Farm Pesto was cheese loaded and double-layered, but it did not have enough pesto to be called a Pesto Pizza. It's like calling a politician - a politician.

This week, I've been sluggish to go to swimming, maybe it's the gloomy weather with occassional heavy rains. It's difficult to stay motivated and leave the house. But, I made it to badminton all 3 days, let's call it a win.

Getting my Japanese worked up with Duolingo these days. I have a love hate relationship with Anki for Kanji. I loved it at first and now it's .. let's call it, boring? Duolingo is spaced repetition as well, but it comes with an advantage to use all my senses and learn something, unlike Anki. I loved the sentence formation exercises on Duolingo, also the gamification of building up XPs keeps up with the bandwagon. 

Professional updates:

Got myself the famous TD practice tests, finally. It was the most recommended mock practice test in [/AWSCertifications][aws_certification_reddit]. To give you a perspective, this beast has 9 timed tests and 9 review tests with flashcards and 1 final exam. I haven't started with any of them, but it's a must have for the price you are paying against the value.
