Completed 30 days streak on DuoLingo. While it was such a pain to even get 10 minutes per day, but I think I've learned a bit more Japanese and a lot more discipline. The next goal is to make that 30 to 60. Excited to learn new words, and sentence formation. 

New words that I learned these week:

コンビニ `Convenience Store`
デパート `Department Store`
どこ `Where`
ここ `Here`
そこ `There`

I've not been consistent with Swimming and Badminton in the past week. Even stopped with the early morning walks. Hopefully, I'll get back on track with these real soon.

I've started time tracking my AWS progress, I've started revisiting EC2 and I just realized that I missed out on many granularity such as `Bastion Hosts`, `ENI, ENA and EFA`, `AWS Nitro`.  The next step is to re-visit Auto Scaling.
