This week was kinda special, mostly because of Ganesh Chaturthi. It hit me that I've never actually been away from home during these 10 days of festivities. It's always been a time of family, food, and just soaking in the vibes. But this year, things are a little different—I’ll be off to Bangalore from the 11th to the 15th. Not gonna lie, I’m a bit sad about missing out on the usual celebrations, but hey, at least I'll make it back in time for the Visarjan on the 17th. So, I guess I won’t miss out on all the fun after all!

On the flip side, I’m really looking forward to visiting Bangalore. I’ve got some cool plans lined up, especially a weekend trip to Chikmagalur with my colleagues. It’s gonna be a blast! I’ve heard the coffee there is out of this world, so you know I’m definitely trying some of that. Plus, I’m planning to indulge in some amazing food—I mean, what’s a trip without treating your taste buds, right?

Switching gears a bit, my Japanese learning journey has been nothing short of fun. I’m 68 days in as I write this, and I’m aiming to hit 100 days soon. It’s crazy how time flies, but even though I’ve been at it for a while, I still feel like I haven’t made a huge dent yet. But hey, they say learning a language is a never-ending process, right? You just keep getting better and better. I’m determined to keep my streak going and hopefully carve out some extra study time once I get my hands on Genki 1. Fingers crossed!

So yeah, that’s what’s been going on with me this week. Busy, a little bittersweet, but also super exciting. Can't wait to see what next week brings!
