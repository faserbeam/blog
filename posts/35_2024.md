My weekend started off with a visit to YUI, a popular Japanese restaurant in Mumbai. Along with my former interns, I indulged in the Edamame Avocado Roll, a delectable combination of creamy avocado and savory edamame wrapped in a seaweed sheet. The roll was the perfect appetizer, complemented by a dollop of spicy wasabi.

After our Japanese feast, we headed to 1441 Pizzeria for dinner. We decided to try their Gourmet Pizza, and as always, it was a hit. The pizza was loaded with fresh ingredients, had a perfectly cooked crust, and was bursting with flavor. Unfortunately, the masala lemonade was still a disappointment, but I'm hoping it's just a fluke.

The following day, I started my morning with a hearty South Indian breakfast at Granville IDC. Their Sada Ghee Dosa is a classic that never fails to satisfy. The crispy dosa, paired with the rich, buttery ghee and a steaming cup of South Indian filter coffee, is the perfect way to start the day.

In addition to my culinary adventures, I've been making progress on my Japanese language learning journey with Duolingo. I recently hit the 60-day mark and am excited to continue improving my skills. The challenges are getting more difficult as I move on to sentence formulation, but I'm up for the challenge.
