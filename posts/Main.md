This is my first blog post. I decided to just randomly come up with the idea to start writing and maintaing blog out of the blue. Although I'm not used to writing a blog, I thought of giving it a shot. To just give a basic introduction about who I am. I'm Kunal and I've been working as a Software Developer for the past 6 years. Currently my job includes to support and develop mission critical scalable systems for [Nasdaq][nasdaq]. Apart from that lately I've started with Swimming and Badminton (Hopefully I keep it up), and I'm currently preparing for [JLPT N5 Japanese][n5] proficiency test. 

The focus of this blog is to write down the conjunction of my personal and professional life (Maybe some dev stuff in future, idk), but not to spam or bombard the information everyday, but once or twice a week. This will actually help me track my Japanese progress ([Kanji][kanji] is tedious. Cries in corner) and maybe even help someone in the future who needs some sort of motivation (including myself).

That's it for this one. Have a great day!
