I came up with the idea to blog every week and the title of the blog would correspond to "Weekly notes {Week number}/{Year}". The idea is to publish contents at the end of the week, so mostly weekends. 

Personal life updates:

I was pretty occupied this week, as I enrolled for Badminton coaching (Yes, finally went through after weeks of waiting). I thought I knew how to play the sport, but playing on wooden court compared to narrow streets in your hometown with cousins is a whole different ball game (It was fun though). Lesson one was how to hold the racquet, and guess what, I've been holding it the wrong all long. I know right, the basics. I used to think that you improve in badminton by just playing badminton, but I was completely wrong. You start with warmup, do the drills, just toss the receives with back hand, forehand and smash, collect shuttles in a batch of 15 (I hate it thought), do ladder drills and by the time your body gives up, the best part of the sport arrives. It's doubles play time. The first day was spot on, I'm ecstatic that I took the odds.

I've reached a personal milestone in Swimming. 25th June, 2024 is D-DAY when I swam without float . I've always been afraid of swimming, it always was synonymous to drowning in my dictionary. But I registered the core memory for the first time when I swam without any support. Although, It drained my stamina half way through the pool, but I won't complain. The target is to keep the momentum and learn newer strokes eventually. More to this in coming weeks.

I've started maintaining physical notes for Japanese. Learning on iPad is super helpful as it gives the flexibility to undo the characters and free flow, but when it comes to writing on paper you have to make sure to adjust the strokes and curves within a box without undo-ing it. Currently, I'm done with Hiragana + Dakuten & handakuten + Yoon and Katakana till N-th level. Target is to complete Katakana by the end of this week and practice more on Kana app.
