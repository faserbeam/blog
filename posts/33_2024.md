The Premier League is back baby, and Arsenal kicked off the season with a thrilling 2-0 victory over Wolves. Watching the Gunners dominate was pure ecstasy! I'm so pumped for the rest of the season. We desperately need to bolster our attacking options. A versatile forward who can fill in for Saka on the right wing would be a game-changer. And don't even get me started on how much I want Mikel Merino in our midfield.

I'm also diving headfirst into the new FPL season. For those who are new to this addictive game, it's basically fantasy football on steroids. Last year was my first rodeo, and it was a wild ride. Currently sitting pretty in second place in my friendly league after just one gameweek feels amazing.

To unwind, I decided to experiment with a [Moka pot][mokapot] and [Cotha's South Indian filter blend][cothas]. The result? Coffee perfection! I was terrified of burning the bottom chamber, but thankfully, a low flame saved the day. It's a small victory, but it feels great to master a new brewing method.

Unfortunately, my swimming and badminton routine has taken a backseat due to the relentless demands of my AWS work. It's a tough balancing act, but I'm trying my best to manage it all.

This week has been a visual treat. I've been lucky enough to witness some breathtaking sunsets. One evening, the sky was ablaze with orange hues, and the next day it was a soft, dreamy pink. Nature's artistry never fails to amaze me.

And if that wasn't enough, I had a surprise encounter with a pretty cool bug on my terrace – a Potamarcha congener. I couldn't resist snapping a quick pic to capture the moment.

To top it all off, I enjoyed a lovely meal out with my dad. He was in his element, savoring his favorite pao bhaji from [Ravindra][ravindra]. Good food and great company – what more could you ask for?

Adios Amigos! See you next week!
