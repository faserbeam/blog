This blog is special, because of the date and week of the year. It's 30th week of the year, and I'm jotting this on 30th July. We are more than half way through the year, and it's a hard pill to digest. Let's hope, we all make the most from the rest of the year. I'll be taking some time out to jot down some resonable and achievable goals for the rest of the year. Nevertheless, I'm proud of what I've achieved in the first half.

Personal updates:

I've missed all the three sessions of Badminton from the past week, majorly because of heavy rains and water clogs. Fortunately, I made some new friends through a friend and scheduled a badminton session on friday for a hour, which then was extended to two. I broke the ice, and re-started swimming. Honestly, I thought, I'd drown or I'd need to start again from basics. But to my surprise, I was able to freestyle without a break (I'll call it as a win).

I've maintained the streak in DuoLingo but the complexity of sentence formation is increasing exponentially. The problem which I'm facing is learning new words specifically `adverbs`, and placing them correctly in conjunction of `verbs` and `nouns`. 

Professional updates:

I completed AWS SAA-C03 training on Udemy. I'm happy that I took down the ~30 hour course which felt like months, honestly. The next goal is to solve TD mock exams and go through vital concepts again.
