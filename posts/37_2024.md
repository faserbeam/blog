I've been slacking on my weekly journal lately, and this week was no exception. But I've got to say, it was quite the adventure.

Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Nasdaq Bangalore office for a quarterly meeting with my colleagues and senior leadership. The trip started early in the morning with a Vistara flight from Mumbai. This was likely my last Vistara flight, as the airline is set to merge with Air India in November. I'll miss their premium flying experience and delicious coffee.

Once in Bangalore, I spent most of my time collaborating with senior leaders. Unfortunately, technical issues hindered my productivity for the first three days.

After a long day of work, I visited Virat Kohli's caf√©, One 8 Commune. The ambiance was nice, but the food options were limited. I then met up with a friend at a third wave coffee shop where I enjoyed a hot green tea matcha and a banana cake.

Throughout my trip, I indulged in some delicious dosas for breakfast. I tried IDC cafe on day one, Varaha on day two and three.

On the weekend, my work friends and I went on a trip to Chikmagaluru, Karnataka. We started our day with breakfast at the famous Town canteen before embarking on a 1.5 km trek to Bandekallu Gudda. The trek was challenging, but the views were breathtaking. We returned to Town canteen for more delicious dosas and then visited Panduranga coffee for a filter coffee.

We also visited the Kedareshwara Temple, a beautiful Hindu temple known for its intricate carvings and peaceful atmosphere.

On my last day in Bangalore, I explored the city, watched the Arsenal vs. Spurs match (Arsenal won!), and then flew back to Mumbai.

It was a whirlwind of a week filled with work, food, and adventure. I'm already looking forward to my next trip to Bangalore.
